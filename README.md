# Crop-Tracker
A Hackathon Project
--------------------

*The objective of this project  : "Track your crops"

The objective is because the problem was like this : 

Due to increase in population in the later future , there will be shortage of land to cultivate crops , which will lead to increasing and sky rocketing prices of crops , which implies that one of the basic human needs which is food will become too expensive to buy . This increasing prices will help countries to grow their economy because of the benefits of exporting the crops to other countries , but it will devastate the conditions within the countries themselevs.

This growth can't be stoped , but thier can be aregulated way to use crops within a country itslef by exporting food from those states which has a lot of it , but doesn't have the required population to use it ,to those states which don.t have the crops but have a large population.

*So the button: Track your crops on page leads to another page , from where user gets to select two states to compare the crop production and then find from whom top export and who will import.
